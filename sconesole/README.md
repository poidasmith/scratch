# Sconesole - remote visual terminal

web-based terminal
    - nodejs daemon
    - run on each/all hosts

sqlite support
    - command runs stored as sqlite?

commands generate "posts" or widgets/apps 
    - think facebook timeline or rich slack/chat with a host
    - query the filesystem/services
    - filesystem/table view
    - can drag/pin executions

each session with a terminal is persisted and queryable as a datasource
    - does it query cached/result data or is it a view on real data?

nodes connect via a p2p/seed of other nodes
    - ability to operate/query other nodes (ssh/ssl equivalent?)
    - 

think about user/role management
    - segregate sessions/users
    - permissions
    - ssh equivalent?

think about version control
    - commands are scripts in git
    - distributed across nodes via git
    - what about data stored?
    - sessions are version controlled? is this necessary?
