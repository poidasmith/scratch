# Binary Codec for JSON

The goal of the Binson project is to produce a binary codec for JSON (json.org). And address some of the shortcomings of BSON spec (bsonspec.org).

The priorities for Binson encoding are (in rough order of priority): 
*	 Small encoding
*	 Fast parsing
*	 JSON spec compatibility
